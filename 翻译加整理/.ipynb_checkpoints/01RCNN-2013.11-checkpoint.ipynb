An alternative is to build a sliding-window detector. CNNs have been used in this way for at least two decades, typically on constrained object categories, such as faces [28, 33] and pedestrians [29]. In order to maintain high spatial resolution, these CNNs typically only have two convolutional and pooling layers. We also considered adopting a sliding-window approach. <font color=#FF0000>However, units high up in our network, which has five convolutional layers, have very large receptive fields (195 × 195 pixels) and strides (32×32 pixels) in the input image, which makes precise localization within the sliding-window paradigm an open technical challenge.</font>\n"

We warp each proposal and forward propagate it through the CNN in order to read off features from the desired layer. Then, for each class, we score each extracted feature vector using the SVM trained for that class. Given all scored regions in an image, we apply a greedy non-maximum suppression (for each class independently) that rejects a region if it has an intersection-over-union (IoU) overlap with a higher scoring selected region larger than a learned threshold."

    "### Domain-specific fine-tuning. To adapt our CNN to the new task (detection) and the new domain (warped VOC windows), we continue stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training of the CNN parameters using only warped region proposals from VOC. Aside from replacing the CNN’s ImageNet-specific 1000-way classification layer with a randomly initialized 21-way classification layer (for the 20 VOC classes plus background), the CNN architecture is unchanged. We treat all region proposals with ≥ 0.5 IoU overlap with a ground-truth box as positives for that box’s class and the rest as negatives. We start SGD at a learning rate of 0.001 (1/10th of the initial pre-training rate), which allows fine-tuning to make progress while not clobbering the initialization. In each SGD iteration, we uniformly sample 32 positive windows (over all classes) and 96 background windows to construct a mini-batch of size 128. We bias the sampling towards positive windows because they are extremely rare compared to background."

    "### Object category classifiers. Consider training a binary classifier to detect cars. It’s clear that an image region tightly enclosing a car should be a positive example. Similarly, it’s clear that a background region, which has nothing to do with cars, should be a negative example. Less clear is how to label a region that partially overlaps a car. We resolve this issue with an IoU overlap threshold, below which regions are defined as negatives. The overlap threshold, 0.3, was selected by a grid search over {0,0.1, . . . ,0.5} on a validation set. We found that selecting this threshold carefully is important. Setting it to 0.5, as in [32], decreased mAP by 5 points. Similarly, setting it to 0 decreased mAP by 4 points. Positive examples are defined simply to be the ground-truth bounding boxes for each class."
